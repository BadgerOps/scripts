# random_scripts


Just a collection of random scripts. Likely not useful for anything... 

You don't want these scripts. I wrote them to make my life easier and they'll probably do nothing to your box, OR
they'll bork your box. Good reference material maybe? Thats why I put them here. So I could reference them. Like a git-blog-post. <3


#### Note:

The `singlehop-deployer` script [has moved here](https://github.com/BadgerOps/singlehop-deployer) for posterity. I think Single Hop got bought out and their API got nuked.
